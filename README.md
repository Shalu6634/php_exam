### PHP RESTful API Project for CRUD Operations
### Project Description
- This project demonstrates the implementation of a RESTful API in PHP for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on three independent tables in a MySQL database. The API follows best practices for RESTful design, using standard HTTP methods like GET, - - POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with the data.


 ## 🚀Three independent tables:
- These tables represent entities in a hypothetical application.
- Users: Stores information about users (id, name, email, password).
- Products: Stores product details (id, name, description, price).
- Orders: Represents customer orders (id, user_id, product_id, order_date).
- The API exposes endpoints for each table to perform CRUD operations.

## 📌 Key Features
- RESTful design: API routes follow REST conventions.
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for each table.
- Error handling: Proper error messages are returned for invalid requests.
- MySQL database: All data is stored in a MySQL database.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- PHP 7+: Server-side scripting language.
- MySQL: Database management system.
- Postman/Insomnia: API testing tools.
- JSON: Data format for API requests and responses.
